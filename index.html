        <strong>Qurbonov Umidbek — Student and Future Developer</strong>
        <h4>HTML · CSS · Python — On the path to becoming a Junior Web Developer</h4>
        <p class="desc">
        Hello! I’m Qurbonov Umidbek. I’m currently studying in the field of information technology,
        learning web technologies (HTML, CSS) and Python. I’ve already built several projects and
        continuously explore new ideas to gain experience. My goal is to become a professional
        web developer.

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <h4>Who I Am and What I Do</h4>
        <p class="desc">
        I study at School No. 22 in Yangiariq District, Khorezm Region. Since the 7th grade, I have been part of the
        “Al-Khwarizmi’s Successors” educational project. My full name is <strong>Qurbonov Umidbek Zaripboy og‘li</strong>.
        </p>
        <p class="desc">
        I have many interests — programming, mobile photography, artificial intelligence, and learning foreign languages
        such as English and Korean. All of these inspire me to grow and improve myself. My goal is to become a
        <strong>highly skilled developer</strong> and study at <strong>Seoul National University in South Korea</strong>.
        </p>
        <p class="desc">
        I am currently learning <strong>HTML,CSS and Python</strong>and I plan to explore
        other programming languages in the future. What I enjoy most about programming is working together with my friends
        to build different parts of a website and finding and fixing my own mistakes — that process truly motivates me.
